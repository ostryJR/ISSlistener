This is a project to automatically try to hear voice and SSTV from the ISS(International Space Station)

It uses(or will be using most probably) sources like:
- Fly-over date and time from: [AMSAT](https://www.amsat.org/track/)
- Radio input from: [WebSDR](http://websdr.org/)

!!!This is a very early stage of the project
